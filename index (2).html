  <h2>About Christian</h2>
    <p>After obtaining my MBA and working in customer facing sales and management positions for several years, I realized I would be a much better fit for creating solutions to problems through software development. I love working on projects and creating solutions for people or companies and took the opportunity to move to the project side of the business industry.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, and am really enjoying what I am learning so far, and can't wait to continue my software development journey!</p>
      <!--Need to style link here  -->
    <p>If you or your organization are looking for a results driven, highly motivated software developer, I would love to discuss an opportunity to help build and improve your software.</p>
